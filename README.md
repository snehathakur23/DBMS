# DBMS
Database management system
A database is an organized collection of data.
A relational database, more restrictively, is a collection of schemas, tables, queries, reports, views, and other elements.
Database designers typically organize the data to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as (for example) modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.
